Today, I worked on:

- Setting up our Plunge project with our team.
- Adding to docker-compose.yml - volumes, postgres setup, pg-admin
- Completed designing the project database structure
- Converted from migrations-based to .sql-based setup
- Completed plunge.sql schema

Team collaboration using screen share to complete the list of tasks above. First experience working on coding as a team - great input from Greg and Simon. Followed instructions from Learn to setup the docker-compose.yml file to set up PostgreSQL. Used notes and references to create .sql file. Made a silly mistake with Git file not updating. Struggled to decide to separate locations from classes and account_details tables. Used diagram from drawsql.app to complete plunge.sql schema.
