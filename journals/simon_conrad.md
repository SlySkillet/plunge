Today I worked on:

- the Docker.yaml file to get our containers running

Travis, Henry, Greg and I worked together, following instructions in the project setup to get our Docker Containers running. Now that we have our development environment created we can begin building out table in the database.

Today was my first experience setting up a SQL database in Docker. I'm happy it went smoothly.
